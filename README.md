# Vigen√®re Cipher (Python)

This repository contains a simple implementation of the **Vigen√®re cipher**, a classical cryptographic technique that encrypts and decrypts messages using a keyword.

The project demonstrates:
- How the Vigen√®re cipher works
- How to encrypt and decrypt text
- How to preserve spaces and special characters
- Example usage in Python

## üîë What is the Vigen√®re Cipher?

The Vigen√®re cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.  
It‚Äôs more secure than a simple Caesar cipher because the shift changes with each letter.
